Lemma tequality_mkc_equality_sp_eq {p} :
  forall lib (a1 a2 b1 b2 A B : @CTerm p),
    equality lib a1 a2 A
    -> (tequality lib (mkc_equality a1 a2 A) (mkc_equality b1 b2 B)
        <=> (tequality lib A B # equality lib a1 b1 A # equality lib a2 b2 A)).
Proof.
  introv eqa.
  split; intro h; repnd; dands; auto.
  - rw @tequality_mkc_equality_sp in h; sp.
  - rw @tequality_mkc_equality_sp in h; repnd.
    repndors; spcast; eauto 3 with nequality.
  - rw @tequality_mkc_equality_sp in h; repnd.
    repndors; spcast; eauto 3 with nequality.

      apply equality_sym in eqa; apply equality_refl in eqa; auto.
    + eapply equality_respects_cequivc_right;[exact h|].
      apply equality_sym in eqa; apply equality_refl in eqa; auto.
