  We now prove the truth of several rules about the intersection type.

(* [3] ============ ISECT MEMBER FORMATION ============ *)

  We can state the intersection member formation rule as follows:

<<
   H |- isect x:A. B ext b

     By isect_memberFormation lvl(i) z ()

     H [z : A] |- subst B x z ext b
     H |- A = A in Type(i)
